# ds-study

Fun project to implement some of the common data structures that I originally
learned in C/Java in Clojure.

Follows along with the http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithm-Analysis-Edition/dp/0132576279 , which is the book I originally was taught data structures from  (2nd ed)

I would strongly advise against using any of these namespaces in a production environment.  Many will contain non-tail optimized recursion and may blow the stack For educational purposes only!

## Lists

I think it's a bit redundant to go over list data structures in a LISP so
I will begin with Trees.

## Trees

 1. Simple binary search tree. section 4.3
 * `/src/ds_study/binary_tree.clj`
 2. AVL (balanced) binary tree
 * TODO


## Usage

Read, clone, fork, REPL....whatever you want.
